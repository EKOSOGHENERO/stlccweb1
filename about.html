					<h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
						<p>  ST Lazarus Christ Church International Incorporated World Wide was divinely born by the urge of the Holy Spirit with specific instructions of the Lord to His Holiness Saint Lazarus Africa Arhavwarien (The Miracle Man of God). God called Saint Lazarus for certain purposes which were the restoration of the Sabbath Day and the restoration of Miracle Ministry.</p>
						<p>His Holiness Saint Lazarus Africa Arhavwarien whom God called to found ST Lazarus Christ Church Int. Inc. World Wide, was born 1908 into the family of Arhavwarien Odjofu in Eghwu-Urhobo, Ughelli South L.G.A , Delta State, Nigeria. Saint Lazarus was among the pupils who left Warri with the white Rev Father to start the Roman Catholic School now called Eghwu Primary School and the Roman Catholic  Church both in Eghwu main town. Saint Lazarus joined the Roman Catholic Church and he impressed the missionary at that time because of his brilliance and his special gift. The Reverend Father then used him as a mass server, reading of the Bible and interpreting same to the congregation at that time.</p>
						<p>The church was started at Ekiugbo, Ughelli in the premises of Ifaka Providence School, a private school, where Saint Lazarus was the Headmaster. When the church started, the members worshiped on Sundays. Saint Lazarus would go to his normal catholic fellowship within the school compound. It was a kind of service done on Sunday on inter-denominational basis. The service was held in the evening. When the fellowship first started, it seemed an ordinary fellowship or service but as prayers were said and the word of God was preached the power of the Lord manifested in the fellowship as several miracles were wrought through the prayers of Saint Lazarus. People from all walks of life came from far and near to receive solution to their problems. During the fellowship or service the blind received their sight, the lame walked, the barren women became mothers, people suffering from different kinds of sicknesses were healed. People came to him and he prayed for them and they got their solutions for whatever problem they had. In some cases, people with several infection and dreaded sicknesses like leprosy and chicken pox were instantly healed after prayers. His healing power through prayers brought him instant fame and popularity far and wide. He became really famous as a healer and a prophet of God. God told him specifically and categorically that the Sabbath day worship had been neglected and forgotten by many people on Earth. God instructed him to revive the Sabbath day worship, so the day of worship in the church was changed from Sunday to Saturday.</p>
						<p>Nevertheless, the miracles continued to attract large crowds to the church from the beginning. So right from the beginning the membership of the church was large. The church was formally founded in Eghwu main town which is the church Headquarters in 1925. At the beginning, the mode of worship consisted of the use of candle and the crucifix. The first set of ministers were ordained in 1940 in Eghwu-Urhobo and shortly other branches sprang up. Saint Lazarus told the church that according to the divine directive the Sabbath day should be maintained and be taught in all the churches (Exodus 20:8-9).Saint Lazarus had to comply and the Sabbath day worship was restored. The church was listed by the colonial master in 1945 and later incorporated as an entity in 1986.Since then the church has recorded more growth and much has been done and achieved.</p>
						<p>In 1974, God told Saint Lazarus that he was to depart from the Earth in February 13, 1975.Saint Lazarus was aware of the date of his departure, the month and time. In December 1974, during the church annual convention called Christian Feast of Dedication, he took the census of members of the church and number of the branches. The census of members and branches was done to teach on how to keep church records and to prepare a hand over note to his successor. All this record taking and the census took place in the Festival held at the church Headquarters Eghwu main town. Unknown to the congregation that December 1974 was to be his last encounter with them on planet Earth. At the peak of the Festival he told the congregation that he will be traveling to England, London precisely for further study, not knowing that he was speaking in parable. He appointed and ordained Pastor Brownson .E. Omote of Eghwu as Oloriode. He told the church that the newly appointed leader would take over the control of the church until he returned. In February 13, 1975 by 4:00pm, the Light of Africa, the man who could dance the dance of Angels for hours without getting tired, the rich man who decided to dwell with the poor, the strong and powerful man who decided to dwell among the weak and powerless, the wealthy man who agreed to suffer for people to have solution to their problems, the man who could feed the multitude with the food he cooked by himself, the miracle man of God, the man who raised the dead back to life, the man who healed the blind, the sick, the Founder and the 1st  General Overseer of ST. Lazarus Christ Church Int. Inc. World Wide, His Holiness Saint Lazarus Africa Arhavwarien (The Miracle Man Of God) departed this world to join his creator in Heaven.</p>
						<p>Pastor Brownson .E.Omote was ordained a Pastor in 1960 and became a Bishop, Oloriode in 1974. He was installed Archbishop in 2001. As a great man of God, His Grace Archbishop Brownson .E. Omote performed several miracles which proved the word of God. He healed sicknesses,  several barren women became mothers through his prayers and blessings. The poor became rich and restricted demonic powers affecting the members of the church and non-members. Archbishop Brownson .E. Omote never rested in the work. He was indefatigable, committed with fidelity stupendous competence. He facilitated the growth of the church and raised the profile of the church from being an ethnic religious organization to a church internationally recognized and reckoned with by the Christian Association Of Nigeria (C.A.N) and Organization Of African Instituted Churches (O.A.I.C). In July 2004, His Grace Archbishop Brownson .E. Omote appointed and ordained Rev. Dr. Jonathan M.O. Arhavwarien as Bishop. He told the church that Bishop Dr J.M.O. Arhavwarien will be his successor when he passed on. In September 12, 2004, His Grace Archbishop Brownson .E. Omote departed this world to join his creator in Heaven. The great beacon of hope left an indelible foot print in Christendom. Archbishop Brownson .E. Omote left a legacy of high standard in all spheres of life, spiritually he was steadfast, firm, prayerful and had very strong faith in God through Jesus Christ.</p>
						<p>Bishop Dr Jonathan .M.O. Arhavwarien took over the leadership of the church in 2005. Bishop Dr J.M.O. Arhavwarien was born into the family of Arhavwarien Odjofu by Late Pa Michael .O. Arhavwarien, brother of the Founder. He attended primary school at Omafuvwe, Eghwu and obtained his First School Leaving Certificate, thereafter, he attended Deeper Life Bible School at River State in 1978 and obtained Certificate in Religious Studies from Blessed Bible College. In 1986, he obtained Bachelor of Theology. He was ordained prophet and Evangelist by Saint Lazarus. In 1990, he was made assistant Pastor up till September 29,1994 when he was ordained by Archbishop Brownson .E. Omote as a Reverend. When ST.

Under his administration as the Bishop and General Overseer of the church, the church has recorded huge and tremendous achievements.

					<h3>OUR BELIEFS</h3>
					<b>THE BIBLE TEACHING</b>
					<p> We believe that the entire Scripture, both Old and New Testament are written by the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit (2 Tim. 3:16-17). All the Christian teachings and the Christian attitude of the children of God are such as are established in the Holy Bible (2 Tim. 3:10-15; 2 Peter 1:21; John 17:17; Psalm 119:105).</p>
					<P> We believe that the Bible is the written and revealed will of God. Man’s position to God, the way to obtain Salvation, Woe and Destruction awaiting Sinners that refuse to repent and everlasting Joy that is kept for the Born again Souls. All the Bible teachings are Holy, what the Bible reveals as the will of God are such that we should accept and whatever God writes in the Bible and His Law are to remain unchangeable, for the Heavens and Earth may pass away but the Word of God stands forever.(Deut.4:12; Rev. 22:18-19; Matt. 24:34-38).</P>
					<b>ABOUT GOD</b>
					<p> Psalm 33:6-9. As revealed unto us by Bible, we believe that there is only One God, who is the creator of both visible and invisible creatures (Gen. 1:1; Ps. 86:9-10; Isaiah 43:10-11; John 1:1-3). Only God will be in existence forever (Ezekiel 3:14), in God every creature receives Life (John 5:26).</p>
					<b>ABOUT JESUS CHRIST</b>
					<p> We believe that He is the Son of God, Who took away our sins and the Savior of the World. We also believe that Jesus Christ is God and was born by Virgin Mary. He is God revealed in the Flesh. Through Him All things were created (John 1:1-14; John 14:9; Matt. 1:18-25; Isaiah 53:5-6). We believe in His Death on the Cross and Resurrection, by which He brought Redemption (Isaiah 53:4-10; 1Peter 2:24; John 10:11; Gal. 3:13; Matt. 20:28; 1Corith.15:3; Rom. 4:25; 2Corith. 5:14; Heb. 9:26).</p>
					<b>ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT</b>
					<p>The Holy Spirit is the third Person in the TRINITY. He has the same Power, the same Glory with God the Father and God the Son (John 14:16-17; John 15:26; Matt. 3:16; Acts 13:24). He is One with Father and the Son who is to be worshiped and served. Three Persons that become One are the source of Blessings to All the Living Creatures in Heaven and on Earth (Matt. 28:19; 2Corith. 13:14; 1 John 1:5-7). The Holy Spirit has a great work to perform. He Teaches, He Speaks to Men and Bears Witness in Us (Acts 16:6-7). He performs the work of regeneration for Man (John 3:5-6); He also performs the work of Sanctification in the born again Souls until they are fully Sanctified (John 16:8; Eph. 1:17-19; 2 Thess. 2:13; 1Corith. 6:11). The Holy Spirit endows believers with Gifts they can use (1Corith.12:7). He empowers one in the Lord (Acts 1:8).</p>
					<b>ABOUT TRINITY</b>
					<p>The egg is compressed of three parts; the yellow yolk, the whitish part and the shell. Despite these three (3) substances, the egg is not three but One. Likewise, We believe that God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost (Spirit) are ONE IN TRINITY (Gen. 1:16-29; Matt. 3:6-17; Matt. 18:19).</p>
					<b>THE LORD'S DAY</b>
					<p>We believe that the Seventh Day of the week called Saturday is a special day which the believers should separate as the Lord’s Day during which time are to gather to worship God (Exodus 20:8-11; Deut. 5:12-14; Ezekiel 20:19-20; Isaiah 58:13-14; Gen. 2:3; Mark 2:23-28; Matt. 12:12; Lev. 23:3; Heb. 4:9-10; Lev. 26:2; Deut. 5:15).</p>
					<b>OUR GARMENT</b>
					<p> We believe that any born again soul is a child of God and is clothed with White Garment which is the Righteousness of Christ. It is received freely, a gift unto them that lead a victorious life (Rev. 19:7-8). It is applicable to both Ministers, Members, Men, Women and Children according to the Holy Scriptures (Lev. 8:1-5; Mark 9:3; Rev. 3:18; Rev. 4:4; Matt. 17:2; Matt.28:3; Acts 10:30; Rev. 3:5). Furthermore, we are advised to put on Charity, which is the bond perfection (Col. 3:13-14). We believe that all members must be moderate in adornment. “Not with braided hair, or gold or pearls, or costly array, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price” (1Tim. 2:8-9; 1Peter 3:1-6; Gen. 35:1-4; Exodus 32:1-8).</p>
					<b>VISION AND PROPHECY</b>
					<p>We believe in all the prophecies in the Bible, likewise we believe that we can be given the gift of prophecy by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (1Corith. 14:29). Despite not prophesying (1Thess.5:20). In ST Lazarus Christ Church Int. Inc. World Wide, the role and importance of Visions and Prophecies are not undermined. We believe that God is for all ages. We believe in Miracles and Prophecies (Prob. 29:18; Num. 12:6; Hosea 12:10; Psalm 89:19; Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17; 2Corith. 12:1; Matt.17:9; Luke 24:23).</p>
					<b>FASTING AND PRAYER</b>
					<p>We believe in Prayers as a means of communication to God and relies on God for ultimate answer. We believe that fasting and prayer can be used to strengthen the individual spiritually and can be used to resolve and solve any knotty problem (Matt. 17:21). The Holy Spirit helps his infirmities in Prayer (Rom. 8:26). We must Pray only by the Name of Jesus Christ (John 16:23; 1Tim. 2:25). Without Faith, our prayer shall be powerless before God (James 1:6-8; Heb. 11:6). Those who are unable to Pray annoy God (Isaiah 42:22; Isaiah 64:6-7). Much trouble and danger are encountered in the absence of Prayer (Zeph. 1:4; Dan. 9:13-14; Hosea 8:13-14). We are commanded to Pray and not to faint and to Pray without ceasing (Col. 4:2; 1Thess. 5:17; 1Corith. 7:5; Luke 18:1). It is God’s plan and order that we should pray to receive all the good He has promised in His treasure for us (James 4:2; Dan. 9:3; Matt. 7:7-11; Matt. 9:24-29; Luke 11:13).</p>
					<b>BAPTISM</b>
					<p> We believe in baptism by the Name of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost (Matt. 28:19). The teaching is revealed in the New Testament and all Christian must obey this rule of the Lord (Acts 2:24; Acts 16:15; Acts 18:8; Acts 19:4-5). Every save soul automatically qualifies for Water Baptism (Acts 8:29-39; Acts 16:18-23). We believe that all members of this Church should receive immersion Water Baptism in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, as believers who would not add to or take out of the Word of God (Matt. 28:19). The reason for Water Baptism is that Water Baptism stands for a sign and example of two things;
						<ol>
							<li>It is an outward sign, an example of a true repentance of a sinner from his or her sins (Acts 2:38; Acts 22:6).</li>
							<li>Anybody who baptized is joined with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection (Rom.6:1-23; Col. 2:113). Therefore, it symbolizes the adoption of such person into the Family of Christ as a child of God.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<b>HOLY COMMUNION (THE LORD'S SUPPER) AND CONFIRMATION</b>
					<p>It is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ shortly before His death. He commanded all Christians to gather together regularly to share the bread and wine which is the representation of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ respectively till He comes back again (Luke 22:17-20; Matt. 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; 1Corith.10:18-21; Acts 2:42; 1Corith. 11:23-30). Every confirmed member of the Church is eligible. In case of Confirmation of members, the Church organizes a Confirmation Ceremony. This is a sacramental declaration. It is an oath of call to duty in the Lord’s Vineyard throughout a member’s Life time (Acts 8:14-17; Acts 19:5-6; Eph. 1:13; Eph. 4:30; Heb. 6:2; John 6:27; Rev. 9:4; 14:1; 22:4).</p>
					<b>HOLY MATRIMONY</b>
					<p> Marriage is honorable in all (Heb. 13:4). Therefore all members who wish to marry could do so in the Church. We believe and practice solemnization of marriage before the Altar to receive sanctification (Gen. 2:24; Mark 10:9; Eph. 5:25-33; Prob.18:22). However, native law and custom must be done first before doing this.</p>
					<b>DEDICATION OF CHILDREN</b>
					<p>We believe that after a child is born the parents should bring him or her unto the House of the Lord for dedication unto the Lord (1Sam. 1:22; Luke 22:22-24; Matt. 19:13-15).</p>
